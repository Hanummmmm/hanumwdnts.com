          My name is Hanum, an Information Systems student at MH Thamrin
          University. I have a strong interest in technology, especially in
          application development, databases, and data analysis. Throughout my
          studies, I have been involved in various projects that require both
          teamwork and individual effort, which has helped me strengthen my
          problem-solving, time management, and communication skills. In
          addition to my academic experience, I strive to further develop my
          skills independently by exploring the latest technologies and
          deepening my technical expertise. With this foundation of knowledge
          and experience, I am committed to continuous growth and contributing
          to the creation of innovative, effective, and impactful digital
          solutions in the field of information technology.

            The Ecampus application project that I developed using Android
            Studio was an individual assignment during my 4th semester. This
            application focuses on student data management with its main
            features consisting of inputting student data and viewing student
            data.

            The Belajarin Aja Yuk! application project was a team collaboration
            that I worked on together with my classmates as part of a course
            assignment. This application was designed to be an interactive and
            practical learning medium, with the aim of making it easier for
            users to access learning materials in a more structured way.
