          My name is Hanum, an Information Systems student at MH Thamrin University.
          I have a strong interest in technology, especially in application development,
          databases, and data analysis. Throughout my studies, I have been involved in
          various projects that require both teamwork and individual effort, which has
          helped me strengthen my problem-solving, time management, and communication skills.
          
          In addition to my academic experience, I strive to further develop my skills 
          independently by exploring the latest technologies and deepening my technical expertise.
          With this foundation of knowledge and experience, I am committed to continuous growth and
          contributing to the creation of innovative, effective, and impactful digital solutions
          in the field of information technology.

            The Ecampus application project that I developed using Android Studio was an individual
            assignment during my 4th semester. This application focuses on student data management
            with its main features consisting of inputting student data and viewing student data.

            The Belajarin Aja Yuk! application project was a team collaboration that I worked on
            together with my classmates as part of a course assignment. This application was
            designed to be an interactive and practical learning medium, with the aim of making
            it easier for users to access learning materials in a more structured way.
